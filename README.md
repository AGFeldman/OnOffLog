Keep a log of when Android display turns on/off. I am interested in using this information to deduce my sleeping patterns.

Log is saved on external storage at `documents/com.agfeldman.onofflog/OnOffLog.txt`. I manually export this file to Dropbox.

Includes plenty of code from https://github.com/ViliusKraujutis/AndroidBroadcastsMonitor.
